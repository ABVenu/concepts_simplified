Sure! Let’s go through each line of your `docker-compose.yml` file and explain its purpose.

---

### **1. `version: '3.8'`**
- **What it is**: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format being used.
- **Why it matters**: Docker Compose uses a specific syntax, and the version determines the available features and behavior. `3.8` is a commonly used version with many features.

---

### **2. `services:`**
- **What it is**: This section defines the services (containers) that make up your application.
- **Why it matters**: Each service in the list represents a container that Docker Compose will run. In this case, you have two services: `node-app` and `mongodb`.

---

### **3. `node-app:`**
- **What it is**: Defines the first service in your app, which is the **Node.js app**.
- **Why it matters**: This service will represent the application that uses MongoDB and listens on port 5000.

---

#### **`build: .`**
- **What it is**: Specifies that the image for this service should be built from the Dockerfile in the current directory (`.`).
- **Why it matters**: Docker Compose will look for a `Dockerfile` in the current directory and build an image based on it. This will allow you to run your app in a container.

---

#### **`container_name: node-app`**
- **What it is**: Defines a custom name for the container running the `node-app` service.
- **Why it matters**: This makes it easier to reference and interact with the container (e.g., using `docker exec -it node-app bash` to open a shell in the container).

---

#### **`ports:`**
- **What it is**: Specifies the port mappings between the host machine and the container.
- **Why it matters**: The application running inside the container listens on a specific port, and you need to map that to a port on your host machine to access it. In this case:
  - `"5000:5000"` maps port 5000 on your local machine to port 5000 inside the container.
  
  So, if your app listens on port 5000 inside the container, you can access it from your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

#### **`volumes:`**
- **What it is**: Mounts a directory from your local machine to the container, so changes in the local directory are reflected inside the container.
- **Why it matters**: This helps with development, allowing you to edit code on your local machine and instantly see the changes inside the container (without rebuilding the image each time).
  - `.:/usr/src/app` mounts the **current directory** (.) on your local machine to `/usr/src/app` inside the container. This is the working directory for the container, where the app's code will reside.

---

#### **`depends_on:`**
- **What it is**: Specifies dependencies between services. In this case, `node-app` depends on the `mongodb` service.
- **Why it matters**: Docker Compose will start the `mongodb` service before starting the `node-app` service, ensuring that the database is up and running before the application tries to connect to it.

---

#### **`environment:`**
- **What it is**: Sets environment variables that the container will use.
- **Why it matters**: Environment variables are often used to configure your app, and here it is used to set the connection string for MongoDB.
  - `MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/todos-app`: This variable tells the Node.js app to connect to the MongoDB service running on the container named `mongodb`, using the default MongoDB port `27017`. The database name is `todos-app`.

---

### **4. `mongodb:`**
- **What it is**: Defines the second service, which is the **MongoDB container**.
- **Why it matters**: This service runs MongoDB in a container, allowing your Node.js app to interact with the database.

---

#### **`image: mongo:latest`**
- **What it is**: Specifies that Docker Compose should pull the latest MongoDB image from Docker Hub.
- **Why it matters**: MongoDB runs in a container from an official Docker image (`mongo:latest`). Using `latest` will ensure you’re using the most recent version of the image.
  
---

#### **`container_name: mongodb`**
- **What it is**: Specifies a custom name for the MongoDB container.
- **Why it matters**: This allows you to easily reference the MongoDB container, just like the `node-app` container, for management and interaction purposes.

---

#### **`ports:`**
- **What it is**: Maps the port of the MongoDB container to a port on the host machine.
- **Why it matters**: This allows you to interact with the MongoDB instance from your local machine.
  - `"27017:27017"`: MongoDB runs on port `27017` inside the container, and this line makes that port available on your local machine as well.

---

#### **`volumes:`**
- **What it is**: Defines a persistent storage location for MongoDB data, even if the container is stopped or removed.
- **Why it matters**: This ensures that data stored in MongoDB is not lost when the container is recreated.
  - `mongodb-data:/data/db`: Creates a named volume (`mongodb-data`) and mounts it to the `/data/db` directory inside the MongoDB container, which is where MongoDB stores its data.

---

### **5. `volumes:`**
- **What it is**: This section defines the named volumes that can be shared between containers and persist data outside the container.
- **Why it matters**: Named volumes help to store data across container restarts and even when the container is removed. In this case, `mongodb-data` ensures MongoDB's data is stored persistently.
  - `mongodb-data:`: This defines a volume called `mongodb-data` for MongoDB data persistence.

---

### **Summary of What Each Service Does**
- **`node-app`**:
  - This is your Node.js application. It is built from a `Dockerfile` (defined in the current directory).
  - It runs on port `5000` and connects to MongoDB.
  - It has a volume mounted to allow code updates without rebuilding the image.
  - It waits for MongoDB to be ready before starting.

- **`mongodb`**:
  - This is the MongoDB database container. It uses the official MongoDB image.
  - It runs on port `27017` and stores data in a named volume (`mongodb-data`) to persist data.

---

### **When you run `docker-compose up`**:
- It will start both the `node-app` and `mongodb` containers.
- Your Node.js app will be accessible via `http://localhost:5000`.
- MongoDB will be running in the background, accessible by the Node.js app, using the connection string defined in `MONGO_URI`.

This configuration is perfect for local development since it isolates dependencies and makes sure your app and database are running in separate containers.
